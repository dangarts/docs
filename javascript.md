# Javascript

## Operator Precedence

- [link](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Operator_Precedence)

## Variables and Data Types

- 5 primitive data types
    - String
    - Number
    - Boolean
    - Null
    - Undefined
- JS has dynamic typing which automatically detects the type of the variable

## Ternary Operator

Alternate way of if/else conditional statements

```
var age = 21;
age >= 18 ? console.log('drinks beer')` : console.log('drinks juice');
```

condition ? if condition is met : else run this statement

## Truthy vs Falsy values

The following renders falsy values

- undefined
- null
- 0
- ''
- NaN

## Array Methods

- `nameOfArray.push('john');` //adds john to end of array
- `nameOfArray.unshift('john');` //adds john to the beginning of array
- `nameOfArray.pop();` //removes the last array element
- `nameOfArray.shift();` //removes the beginning array element
- `nameOfArray.indexOf('john');` //returns the index position of the arument
   - if the element is not in the array, the value `-1` is returned.  This is used for conditional statments.

## Hoisting

- Hoisting works only with function declarations and not function expressions.
   - Function Declaration: `function example(){}`
   - Function Expression: `var example = function(){}`

# Scoping

- Variables defined in the root is accessible everywhere and within functions.
- Global Execution Context
   - Is seperate environment to that within functions
   - If for example `var age` was used twice in the root code and also within a function.  The `age` in the function is defined in the variable object of the **execution context object** of the function and the root variable is defined in the variable of the **global execution context** object.

- Each new function creates a scope
- **Lexical Scoping**: a function that is lexically within another function gets access to the scope of the outer function.

- Scope Chain: Global execution is limited to variable access when variables are used within functions and nested functions.

- Execution stack vs scope chain
   - execution stack is the order functions are called
   - scope chain is the order in which functions are written lexically.

- The `this` keyword
   - In a method, `this` refers to the owner object.
   - Alone, `this` refers to the global object.
   - In a function, `this` refers to the global object.

## method borrowing

- Instead of rewriting a similar method in an object, you can use method borrowing to be used in a separate object.
   - Ex. `joe.calcAge = mike.calcAge` where `calcAge` is a method within the `joe` object.  When the mike object was created, instead of reusing the calcAge method, we simply used the instance in the joe object by storing the method via `joe.calcAge = mike.calcAge`


## DOM Maniputlation

### Querying the DOM
- document.getElementById('someIdName').textContent = ('0');
   - selects the ID someIdName and changes the content to 0
- document.getElementsByClass
- getElementsByTagName
   - returns html Collection
- document.querySelector()
   - new school method
- document.querySelectorAll()

## Prototypes

- Every Javascript object has a **prototype property**, which makes inheritance possible in JavaScript;
- The prototype property of an object is where we put methods and preoperties that we want **other objects to inherit**.
-  The Constructor;s prototype property is **NOT** the prototype of the Constructor itself, it's the prototype of **ALL** instances that are created through it;
- When a certain method (or property) is called, the search starts in the object itself, and if it cannpt be found, the search moves on to the object's prototype.  This continues until the method is found: **prototype chain**.

## Callback Functions

- Callback functions are functions that execute after a preceding function.   This occurs when a function is passed in as an argument to another function and execute after that function is done.
```
// A function which accepts another function as an argument
// (and will automatically invoke that function when it completes - note that there is no explicit call to callbackFunction)




function input(callback) {
  var name = prompt('Please enter your name.');
  callback(name);
}

function greeting(name) {
  alert('Hello ' + name);
}

input(greeting);

```
## Recursion

- is similar to an iterative function but uses a function to call upon itself to cycle over a condition

## Closures

- closure gives you access to an outer functionâ€™s scope from an inner function. In JavaScript, closures are created every time a function is created, at function creation time.

- To use a closure, simply define a function inside another function and expose it. To expose a function, return it or pass it to another function.

- We create a closure when an inner function is made accessible from outside its parent function. This can occur when an outer function returns an inner function. 

- used to protect data
